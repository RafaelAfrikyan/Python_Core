# Data Types. Task 1

## Rounding

Create a function with two parameters `a` and `b`. The function calculates the following expression:

```python
(12 * a + 25 * b) / (1 + a**(2**b))
```

and returns a result of the expression rounded up to the second decimal place.

# Data Types. Task 2

## Fractions

Create a function that takes two parameters of string type which are fractions with the same denominator and returns a sum expression of these fractions and the sum result.

**For example:**

```python
>>> a_b = '1/3'
>>> c_b = '5/3'
>>> get_fractions(a_b, c_b)
'1/3 + 5/3 = 6/3'
```
